\section{Dockapps, panels and statusbars}

Most window managers have some kind of 'dock' or statusbar/panel to give a 
quick overview of running processes and system status. Notion is no 
different - actually we have several options.

When a part of the screen is reserved for this purpose, in Notion this is 
called a ``status display'' or ``stdisp''. You can have one stdisp per Screen 
- it is independent of the current workspace or tiling.

Notion has 2 kinds of stdisp's: if you want to use one or more existing 
panel/dock applications, you can use \file{mod\_dock} with the ``embedded'' 
mode.  Alternatively, you can use the built-in \file{mod\_statusbar}. Since a 
Screen can only hold one stdisp, you can have either - not both.

Notion 4+ loads \file{mod\_dock} by default via  ``cfg_defaults.lua``;
previous versions loaded \file{mod\_statusbar}.
To switch, simply adjust this line to load the other module instead.

\input{conf-dock.tex}

\input{conf-statusbar.tex}
